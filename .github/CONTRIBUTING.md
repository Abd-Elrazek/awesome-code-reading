Contributing Guidelines
---
The goal of this list is to identify high-quality projects that are suitable for learning purposes. We try NOT to be a list of popular open source projects. So when you submit a new project, please give some notion of why it's a good project to read, and how people can go about reading it. Your insight will help spark discussions.

When you submit a pull request, a custom pull request template will be used automatically. Please provide your answers as best you can. See this pull request for [an example](https://github.com/CodeReaderMe/awesome-code-reading/pull/1).

Please make sure you consider the following:
- You have personally read and understand the project. Ideally you can write up a guide or summary so that people can follow.
- You don't have to use the latest release of the project. An earlier version may be much simpler and easier to read. For example, while the Bitcoin codebase is fairly large today, [bitcoin 0.1.5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.1.5) released in 2009 is much manageable and still highly relevant today.
- You don't have to nominate an entire project. A subset or a package within a large project is perfectly fine. As a matter fact, it is less daunting and usually works even better. For example, the [sort](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/sort) package within the Go standard library is self-contained, easy to read, and idiomatic.

Thank you again for contributing!
